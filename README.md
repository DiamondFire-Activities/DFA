### Project is no longer maintained
DiamondFire Activities was once a project I was working on, backed by the DF admin team for when I previously was an admin, that would incorporate fun games during events such as a modified form of Sphere Battles.
Sphere Battles was a mode created by kNoAPP during the early DiamondFire times. It's no longer maintained, and was discontinued after I took a long hiatus for medical reasons, and DiamondFire would eventually create Event Nodes, a much more exciting project at the time that would allow events to run in a large scale environment.

I made the repo public, but beware, the code is awful.

### Features at the time
- SphereBattles didn't get much work done, and I used a horrible way of loading worlds. Basic teams and spawning was done, along with configuration options, but that was about it
- Rank, badge, and permissions system that mirrored DiamondFire's ranks. Badges were to signify who was a DFA staff member or developer. This took the longest
- Basic lobby stuff

### How Sphere Battles would work
Protect your team's "core" (respawn point), grab the resources, and eliminate the other team.

- The entire game takes place in a void world with floating sphereical objects that make up a resource, such as wood or iron. The wooden sphere sphere contains chests filled with bows and arrows, making it very useful for combat.
- Each team has a "core", or respawn point. If your core is broken by an enemy player, it will disable respawns in your team allowing you to be eliminated, making it a number one priority.
- Craft tools and armor, get prepared, and start using the resources to hide and protect the core. Bridge toward the enemy's side of the map, and try to defeat them!
- Some high value spheres exist in the middle of the map containing rare materials like diamond, which carry a significant risk as enemies will try to rush for it, but it offers great reward.
